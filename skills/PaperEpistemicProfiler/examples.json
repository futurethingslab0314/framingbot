            "abstract": "This study investigates how AI-generated feedback influences the iterative design process in a university-level product design studio. Using a qualitative, exploratory approach, we observed 24 students over a 10-week course, collecting reflection journals and semi-structured interviews. Findings reveal that AI feedback accelerated ideation but sometimes narrowed students' creative scope, raising questions about the balance between efficiency and open-ended exploration in design education.",

A genetic algorithm is applied to real-world transit data from a mid-sized city, demonstrating a 12% reduction in average commute time. The results suggest practical guidelines for transit planners seeking cost-effective network improvements.",
